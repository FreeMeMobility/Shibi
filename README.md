## About

Shibi was made to create a standard, people can read and write, which is simple,
appliable to multi-/intermodal searches, flexible, and just simple.

The idea is to have a general standard for the most of the mobility data depending on 
public transport, which is not as complicated as GTFS with Protobuf, and simple to adapt to.

## Adaption

Then we will try to implement it into Shibi and create an endpoint for it.
